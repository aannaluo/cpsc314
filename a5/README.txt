FURTHER COMMENTS: 

BRIEF ASSIGNMENT SELF-ASSESSMENT:
  I learned a lot about the texture maps, and also how the js and html file communicate with 
  each other by passing variables from the js file to the fragment shaders in the html file.
  I also learnt to use many different GLSL functions that I have never experimented with before.
  Finally, I struggled the most with the environment map and making it work.

  For the creative part, I tried to implement a wave noise texture, and although I was able to implement
  the noise texture itself, I had trouble making it move in relation to time. I tried to use the clock, 
  in order to increment it however, I was unable to ultimately figure out how to make it work the exact
  way I wanted it to. However, I was able to implement the clock and create a rotation based on it. 
  
  I also changed the toon shading, where I created more different colour segments, as well as changing the
  shading, to have a ring-like shadow over it. I implemented the motions with the sphere to practice
  working with two different concepts and seeing how I can merge it into one. 
  
WRITTEN QUESTIONS
(h)(i) When I changed it to the ocsPosition the image stopped moving with the rotations.

(h)(iii) The edges of the colours of the shader are more rough, and give it a more rough-like pattern
whereas when there were less levels, the blocks of colours were very smooth.
